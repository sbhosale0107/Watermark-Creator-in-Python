Watermarking is a technique used to add a recognizable image or text on top of another image to protect its copyright or to indicate the source of the image. In Python, you can create a watermark on an image using the Pillow library.

Pillow is an open-source Python Imaging Library that allows you to manipulate images, including adding watermarks. With Pillow, you can load, edit, and save images in various formats, such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, and more.

Here are the basic steps to create a watermark on an image using Pillow:

-Load the input image using the Image class from the Pillow library.
-Define the text or image to be used as the watermark.
-Define the font and size for the text watermark (if applicable).
-Calculate the position for the watermark on the input image.
-Create a new ImageDraw object for the input image.
-Draw the watermark on the input image using the text or image method of the ImageDraw object.
-Save the watermarked image using the save method of the Image class.
-You can customize the appearance of the watermark by changing the font, size, color, and transparency. You can also use an image file as the watermark instead of text.
